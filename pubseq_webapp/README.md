# Running the Webapp

## Dependencies Installation

If the webapp bundle is cloned/forked from github, install dependencies defined at `package.json`. See for example here (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8367031/how-do-i-install-package-json-dependencies-in-the-current-directory-using-npm).

## Running the up

As of current dev version 0.0.1, just do `node apps.js` in this directory.
